# Regular-expression derivatives reexamined with Coq

[Regular-expression derivatives reexamined](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/re-deriv.pdf) is a paper by Scott Owens, John Reppy and Aaron Turon.

In this repo we try to prove some things that are mentioned in the paper as a way to teach ourselves some Coq.
