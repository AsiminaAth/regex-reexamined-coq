# Regular-expression derivatives reexamined with Coq

[Regular-expression derivatives reexamined](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/re-deriv.pdf) is a paper by Scott Owens, John Reppy and Aaron Turon.

In this repo we try to prove some things that are mentioned in the paper as a way to teach ourselves some Coq.

## Setup

1. Install Coq 8.11.1
2. Remember to set coq in your PATH. For example, in your `~/.bash_profile` add `PATH="/Applications/CoqIDE_8.11.1.app/Contents/Resources/bin/:${PATH}"` and run `$ source ~/.bash_profile`.
3. Run make in this folder.

Note:

 - `make cleanall` cleans all files even `.aux` files.
